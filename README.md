# Onemonth-js

This is a practice aims at helping me reviewing the content of basic JavaScript.

# Week 1

Basic JavaScript Practice
- Used prompt for user to insert name
- Used Math.floor / Math.random to gernerate random number and round the number
- Conditional render: when specific name is inserted, special message will come out

# Week 2

- For loop
- DOM: document.querySelector/ document.createElemt/ document.getElementById
- addEventListener: click, keypress, keyup
- create function
- Used Giphy API for the week-2 project

# Week 3

- Completed a Shazam Player App
- included a search bar for users to search for songs, and added them to the Playlist on the side bar, and used locaStorage to keep the list on when refreshing the page
- Main takeaways: 
1. get input value from search bar
2. destructure the API data and get the acurate response from the data
3. create a playlist that user can add songs they like in there and store in the local machine
4. create a clear button and delete the localStorage list
